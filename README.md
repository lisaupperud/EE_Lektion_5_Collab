# Solution 1.0

### Issues with `shouldDeleteProductSuccessfully()` in `ProductControllerTest`

There were two issues with the test: the path to the `DELETE` endpoint and the returntype of the `deleteProductById()` method.

#### Original Endpoint & Method:

    @DeleteMapping("/delete")
    public Mono<Void> deleteProductById(@PathVariable @Positive Long id) {

        return productService.deleteProductById(id)
                .map(product -> ResponseEntity.status(204)).then();
    }

---

**Path to Endpoint**

The path was `/api/v1/product/delete`, but the method parameter contains a `@PathVariable` for `id`. The variable needs to be included in the path, otherwise Spring can not match the path variable to the URL, which caused the test to return **404 NOT_FOUND**.

**Solution:**

Add `/{id}` to the endpoint so the full path looks like:

`/api/v1/product/delete/{id}`

---

**Returntype of method `deleteProductById()`**

The original returntype was `Mono<Void>` which does not allow returning a proper HTTP status. Because of this, even though the product was deleted, Spring returned **200 OK** instead of the expected **204 NO_CONTENT**, causing the test assertion to fail.

**Solution**

Change the method to return `Mono<ResponseEntity<Void>>` and map the result to `ResponseEntity.noContent()` after the delete operation:


    @DeleteMapping("/delete/{id}")
    public Mono<ResponseEntity<Void>> deleteProductById(@PathVariable @Positive Long id) {

        return productService.deleteProductById(id)
                .then(Mono.just(ResponseEntity.noContent().build()));
    }
